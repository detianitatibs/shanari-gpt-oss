# Tooling rules for OpenCode

- Consider by English and answer by Japanese.
- MUST write documentation and comment by Japanese.
- Use OpenCode tools only: read, write, edit, list, glob, grep, webfetch, bash, task, todowrite, todoread.
- Do NOT call non-existent tools like Repo_browser.\* .
- Prefer `edit` for modifying existing files; use `read` to inspect before editing; use `write` for new files.
- Do NOT execute `git add` and `git commit`. This operation is executed by user.
